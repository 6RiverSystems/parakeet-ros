ROS node which utilizes the [Parakeet-SDK](https://github.com/MechaSpin/parakeet-sdk) to communicate with a Parakeet Pro or Parakeet ProE LiDAR sensor using ROS.

An example of executing the ROS node and interacting via rviz can be found as part of the [v1.0.0 release](https://github.com/MechaSpin/parakeet-ros/releases/tag/v1.0.0)
